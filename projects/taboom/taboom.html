                            audience engagement and participation. This interactive game increased viewer retention and
                            led to a <span class="body-bold">390% rise in monetization</span>, with viewership growing
                            from 10 to 300, a <span class="body-bold">2,900% increase in participation</span> during
                            trivia streams.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">Background</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">Taboom is a platform that helps creators monetize their niche audiences
                        through viewer gifts. These gifts are a form of <span class="body-bold">virtual currency that
                            creators can exchange for real money through cashouts</span>. However, creators with smaller
                        audiences struggled to grow, as the platform was relatively new and had difficulty attracting
                        users from more established platforms like Twitch and Instagram.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="details-item">
                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">The Problem</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">Although Taboom allowed creators to earn <span class="body-bold">more money
                            from smaller audiences than on other platforms</span>, the biggest issue remained: bringing
                        their followers from well-established platforms to the new app. Creators struggled to migrate
                        their existing audience, making it difficult to grow their viewership and make users create
                        habit on Taboom.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="details-item">
                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">The Goal</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">Our goal was to help creators <span class="body-bold">attract and engage
                            larger audiences</span>, providing them with the tools necessary to retain their current
                        viewers and encourage audience migration from more established platforms. We aimed to create an
                        experience that would set Taboom apart and help creators grow their viewership while fostering
                        deeper engagement.</p>

                <div class="details-item">
                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">The Solution</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">
                        We developed a real-time trivia feature to enhance audience interaction and drive participation.
                        This experience significantly boosted viewer retention and engagement, leading to <span
                            class="body-bold">a 390% increase in monetization</span> for creators. Viewership during
                        trivia-enabled streams surged, with creators who had previously averaged 10 viewers per stream
                        seeing participation <span class="body-bold">grow to 300-400 viewers.</span>

            <p class="body-regular">We began by conducting in-depth research to understand the pain points of
                small-scale creators trying to grow and engage their audience on Taboom. This involved 15 interviews
                with creators and surveys completed by 120 audience members. We aimed to uncover why creators struggled
                to migrate their audience from mainstream platforms and what kept their viewers engaged.</p>

                        Many creators found it hard to convince their audience to move from well-established platforms
                        like Twitch or Instagram, where they were already comfortable. They highlighted the importance
                        of offering something unique to incentivize migration.

                    <p class="body-regular">
                        Creators also revealed that they needed more engaging features to keep smaller audiences from
                        leaving mid-stream. Traditional platforms offered minimal tools for niche creators to maintain
                        consistent engagement, leaving them feeling lost in a sea of influencers with larger followings.

                    Throughout this phase, I collaborated closely with designers, PMs, and the content team during
                    design critique sessions, where each team provided valuable input.

            <p class="body-regular m-b-2">For the delivery phase, we opted for a phased rollout to specific creators,
                starting with an MVP. In this first version, creators had to submit quiz questions and answers in a CSV
                format, which we manually uploaded to the database. This allowed us to test the feature’s usage and
                value before committing to developing a fully integrated quiz creation interface.</p>

            <h3 id="rollout" class="heading-1 m-b-1">Phased Rollout</h3>
            <p class="body-regular m-b-1">We selected 10 creators from different regions and content genres to
                participate in the MVP launch. These creators provided feedback on the MVP version, which allowed us to
                capture diverse user experiences across different types of audiences. Initially, the creators would
                email us their quiz questions in CSV format, which we would upload directly to the database.</p>
            <p class="body-regular m-b-1">
                Key benefits of this phased approach included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="body-regular">Testing the real-world usage of the trivia widget without overwhelming the
                    development resources.</li>
                <li class="body-regular">Collecting early feedback from creators, which helped validate the feature’s
                    demand and identify additional improvements before launching a fully-featured version.</li>

            <h3 id="documentation" class="heading-1 m-t-2">Documentation & Design System</h3>
            <p class="body-regular m-b-1">Apart from updating the Design System on Figma, the entire process was
                documented in ZeroHeight, ensuring that every aspect of the trivia widget was properly described for
                developers, from interaction flows to animation details.</p>
            <p class="body-regular m-b-1">The design system was updated to include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="body-regular">New components for the trivia widget interface.</li>
                <li class="body-regular">Guidelines for the tie-breaker system, leaderboard, and real-time feedback.

            </div>
            <p class="body-regular m-b-2">The trivia widget was a game-changing feature for Taboom, significantly
                increasing creator engagement and monetization. Before the feature, creators with an average of 10
                viewers <span class="body-bold">now attracted 300-400 participants</span> during quiz-enabled streams.
                Monetization saw a <span class="body-bold">390% increase in gift donations</span>, and session lengths
                <span class="body-bold">extended by 40%</span> due to the competitive nature of the quizzes.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-1 m-b-1">Key Results:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold">Audience Retention:</span> Viewers stayed longer during
                    quiz streams, with creators reporting a surge in engagement, particularly during tie-breaker
                    moments.</li>
                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold">Increased Revenue:</span> Audience participation and
                    gifting behavior drastically improved, validating the monetization strategy tied to interactivity.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading-1 m-t-2 m-b-1">Key Learnings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold">Phased MVP Rollout:</span> Releasing the MVP version
                    allowed us to validate the feature with minimal resources. Using CSV uploads for the quiz questions
                    proved effective for testing engagement before committing to developing a full creator interface.
                </li>
                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold">Iterative Design:</span> Incorporating user feedback
                    (like the tie-breaker system) and simplifying the quiz setup based on creator input resulted in a
                    highly usable feature that required minimal effort from streamers.</li>
                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold">Cross-Functional Collaboration:</span> Continuous
                    alignment between design and development teams ensured that technical constraints were addressed
                    early, leading to a smooth and scalable rollout.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="body-regular m-t-2 m-b-3">Overall, the trivia widget became a standout feature for Taboom,
                empowering creators to better engage their audiences, resulting in stronger audience loyalty and greater
                monetization opportunities.</p>
