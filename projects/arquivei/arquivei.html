                            We redesigned the Analysis Dashboard for Bayer's soy supply chain to enhance data visibility, streamline error detection, and improve user workflows. The redesign led to a <span class="body-bold">120% increase in daily user engagement, a 30% reduction in manual data errors, and a 45% improvement in error resolution times.</span> These changes significantly reduced manual interventions, resulting in more efficient and accurate processes for users.

                <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">Background</h2>
                <p class="body-regular">Arquivei is a financial technology platform that specializes in managing and
                    organizing digital invoices through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology.</p>
                <p class="body-regular m-t-1">By automatically extracting data from invoices, Arquivei helps businesses
                    <span class="body-bold">prevent errors, detect fraud, and ensure accurate reporting</span>. In the
                    Bayer soy supply chain project, this technology was used to <span class="body-bold">track seed lot
                        sales and inventory,</span> providing stakeholders with real-time insights into their
                    operations.
                </p>
                <p class="body-regular m-t-1">However, the original Analysis Dashboard lacked clarity and interactivity,
                    making it difficult for distributors and regional sales managers (RSMs) to efficiently manage data,
                    leading to frequent manual corrections and increased risks of errors and discrepancies.</p>

                <div class="details-item">
                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">The Problem</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">While Arquivei's OCR technology accurately extracted data from invoices, the
                        Analysis Dashboard was difficult for distributors and RSMs to navigate. <span
                            class="body-bold">Users struggled to spot errors and discrepancies in time, leading to
                            manual corrections, delays in decision-making, and
                            increased risks of fraud.</span></p>

                <div class="details-item">
                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">The Goal</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">The goal was to improve how distributors and RSMs interact with the system,
                        helping them easily identify issues, reduce errors, and manage seed lot data more effectively.
                        <span class="body-bold">We aimed to enhance their ability to make data-driven decisions while
                            reducing reliance on manual processes and minimizing potential risks like errors and
                            fraud.</span>

                <div class="details-item">
                    <h2 class="heading-2 m-b-1">The Solution</h2>
                    <p class="body-regular">We redesigned the Analysis Dashboard with improved data visibility,
                        interactive filters, and automated error detection. This allowed users to <span

                            discrepancies, streamline workflows, and take corrective actions, reducing manual

                conducted detailed research aimed at understanding how distributors and RSMs (Regional Sales Managers)

                        The purpose of the interviews was to understand why users were not fully utilizing the dashboard
                        and what improvements could make it more valuable for both distributors and admins.</p>
                    <p class="body-regular m-b-1">
                        During these
                        conversations, users shared critical insights about the limitations they faced, including
                        difficulty accessing relevant data quickly and challenges in using the dashboard for real-time
                        error correction.

                    <p class="body-regular">

                    <p class="body-regular m-t-1">
                        Another noted,

                        These insights made it clear that users needed a more proactive system

                            the data presentation could help users focus on key tasks and reduce confusion.

                    Because we had already gathered significant usability feedback during the wireframing phase and
                    worked
                    closely with the front-end developer, who confirmed the ease of implementation, we decided to move
                    forward without additional usability testing. Instead, we aimed to quickly bring the design into the
                    live environment, where real user interactions would provide more authentic insights and allow for
                    rapid
                    iteration if needed.

                different areas of the dashboard improvements. We worked closely with developers to ensure a seamless

                questions or challenges that arose during the process.</p>

                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold"> Sprint 1:</span> Focused on implementing data
                    visibility improvements and the ability to toggle between list and chart views for both distributors
                    and RSMs.</li>
                <li class="body-regular"><span class="body-bold"> Sprint 2:</span> Introduced automation enhancements,

                    documented detailed guidelines on styling, color use, and interaction patterns for charts. I also
                    helped the team choose chart libraries that would best fit our use cases, ensuring they were

                After delivering the revamped Analysis Dashboard, we closely monitored user behavior to assess the
                success of our changes. The metrics we defined during the Opportunity Tree phase were essential in
                measuring the success of our design. These included error resolution times, the automation index, data
                accuracy, and overall user engagement with the dashboard.</p>
